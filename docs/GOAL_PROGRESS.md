# Durable Goal Progress

Last updated: 2026-05-14
Branch: `codex/durable-goal-stage8-9`

## Contract Checklist

- [x] Read source-of-truth files: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/GOAL.md`, `build.gradle`, `Dockerfile`.
- [x] Read active stage plans: `docs/Stage3.md` through `docs/Stage9-e.md`.
- [x] Start from `git status --short`: clean at recon start.
- [x] Work on a dedicated branch instead of `master`/`main`.
- [x] Establish baseline non-GUI validation.
- [ ] Close or explicitly classify remaining Stage 3-7 blockers before Stage 8/9 parity claims.
- [ ] Implement Stage 8-a client bootstrap and side-safe boundaries.
- [ ] Implement Stage 8-b GUI routing/screens/resources to non-GUI-verifiable completion.
- [ ] Implement Stage 8-c tile/block render registration/classes/resources to non-GUI-verifiable completion.
- [ ] Implement Stage 8-d entity render registration/classes/resources to non-GUI-verifiable completion.
- [ ] Implement Stage 8-e FX/particles/beams/bolts/shader-adjacent safe fallbacks.
- [ ] Implement Stage 9-a recipe/content foundation.
- [ ] Implement Stage 9-b arcane crafting parity.
- [ ] Implement Stage 9-c infusion crafting/enchanting parity.
- [ ] Implement Stage 9-d crucible/alchemy/thaumatorium content flow.
- [ ] Implement Stage 9-e research/Thaumonomicon progression content.
- [ ] Complete Phase 10 polish: localization, sounds, crash cleanup, performance sanity, docs/status cleanup.
- [ ] Run final non-GUI validation: `compileJava`, `build`, `test`, `check-jar`, `smoke-server`, static scans, `git diff --check`.
- [ ] Record GUI/manual graphics checks as skipped by user instruction where they require user interaction or unavailable graphics.
- [ ] End with clean `git status --short` after intended checkpoint commits, or document remaining diffs.

## Current Evidence

- `git status --short`: clean at the start of this run.
- Active branch was created from clean `master`: `codex/durable-goal-stage8-9`.
- `docs/Stage3.md` contains fresh-world core closure notes dated 2026-05-14. Remaining Stage 3 items are documented dependencies/manual scenario coverage, not a pre-Phase8 implementation blocker.
- `docs/Stage4.md` contains fresh-world server/common closure notes dated 2026-05-14. Remaining Stage 4 items are Phase 8/9 dependencies or explicitly deferred reference pieces.
- `docs/Stage5.md` remains open. Recent closure notes show substantial wand, pouch, hover harness, item resource, ItemKey, Compass Stone, Loot Bag, and focus parity work, but remaining common/server utility, relic, focus, hover, and manual scenario validation gaps remain.
- `docs/Stage6.md` remains open. Golem/trunk item routes, Pech behavior, Cultist Portal loot, boss/projectile validation, drops/sounds, and manual scenario matrix remain active blockers.
- `docs/Stage7.md` remains open. Worldgen pipeline, Eldritch ring/maze bootstrap, safe teleporter, Outer Lands room templates, BlockLoot/room block contracts, Greatwood structures, and runtime evidence remain active blockers.
- Stage 8-a through Stage 8-e are documented as not complete.
- Stage 9-a through Stage 9-e are documented as not complete.
- `docs/GOAL_PROGRESS.md` was absent at recon start and is now created to track this contract.

## Skipped GUI/Manual Graphics Checks

- None attempted in this run yet.
- Future GUI/client visual checks that require user-driven Minecraft control, screenshots, or unavailable X11/graphics stack will be recorded as: `SKIPPED by user instruction: GUI/graphics/user-interactive validation excluded`.

## Baseline Validation

- `./scripts/dev.sh compileJava` — passed on 2026-05-14 before gameplay/code changes.

## Next Checkpoint Candidate

Stage 6 and Stage 7 share a concrete blocker around missing reference-compatible `BlockLoot` urn/crate behavior:

- `docs/Stage6.md` requires replacing `EntityCultistPortal` vanilla chest reward placeholders.
- `docs/Stage7.md` requires Outer Lands room templates to stop silently substituting vanilla chests/stone for loot urns/crates and related progression room blocks.

This is a tightly coupled candidate only if the original reference behavior confirms one block/item contract can serve both portal rewards and Outer Lands rooms.
